Hello there! 

i'm Cosyfluf the creator of the Inferno Media Player.
This Media Player is'nt a professional Programm or application, its a Thing I started to make because i was bored. 

From time to time it started to get like it is right now! 

since this is an Opensource Project, i'm open for Feedback and additons!
I would also like if you tell me what you would like to have as a feature added to it if you can't code.

So you have FEEDBACK? Give it to me!
